# Speech-RecognizerBot-in-Python-to-Arduino
I created a Bot in Python to understand the command you will say and send it to Arduino's Idle.	
The default Bot's language is portuguese, but you can change that inside the code.
Make you sure that you have Arduino'idle and Python'idle already installed on your computer.
